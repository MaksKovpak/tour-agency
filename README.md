# Tour agency website

The website of the travel agency **"Equator"**. This is my first web project, written using HTML/CSS and pure JavaScript. The [AlaSQL](https://github.com/AlaSQL/alasql) library was also used to sort products. This is only a demo project, while developing it I was learning JS in parallel, so some things here are deliberately not done correctly.

User registration and authorization, user's personal account, adding products to the cart, sorting and selecting products according to various criteria have been implemented. For the administrator, his admin panel is also available, where he can add a new tour. He can modify and delete tours.
